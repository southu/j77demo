# Deal visibility guide

See which deals are on track and which need attention—without manual updates.

## Why visibility matters

When deal data is scattered across calls and emails, forecasting is guesswork. Centralizing and analyzing that data improves accuracy and keeps deals moving.

## Key practices

- Capture customer conversations in one place
- Surface risks and next steps automatically
- Use the same data for coaching and forecasting

This pairs well with our blog series on revenue intelligence.
